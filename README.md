# <p align = 'center'> Seoul-Bike-Forecast: Riding the Data Waves </p>

## Problem Statement:
In many urban cities, the introduction of rental bikes has significantly enhanced mobility comfort. To ensure the availability and accessibility of rental bikes to the public at the right time, predicting the bike count required at each hour becomes crucial. This prediction aims to minimize waiting times and provide the city with a stable supply of rental bikes. This project focuses on implementing a predictive model to estimate the bike count based on various factors, including weather conditions.

## Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are:

Predict the number of bikes required at each hour for stable rental bike supply.
Utilize weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall) to enhance the accuracy of predictions.
Implement a linear regression model from scratch to achieve the prediction.

## About the Dataset:
The dataset includes the following information:

Temperature: Temperature in Celsius

Humidity: Humidity percentage

Windspeed: Windspeed in m/s

Visibility: Visibility in meters

Dewpoint: Dewpoint temperature in Celsius

Solar Radiation: Solar radiation in MJ/m2

Snowfall: Snowfall in cm

Rainfall: Rainfall in mm

Bike Count: Number of bikes rented per hour

Date Information: Timestamps for each hour
